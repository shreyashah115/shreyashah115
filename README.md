Hi, I am a software engineer.

I like finding solutions to problems; I am always curious about new and existing technologies.

Apart from coding, I also like gaming, ~~listening to audiobooks~~ reading books is better, sketching, sharing my opinions on social media which nobody really cares about.

Sometimes, I like shit-posting on Twitter: http://twitter.com/shreyashah115
