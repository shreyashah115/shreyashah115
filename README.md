Hi, I am a software engineer 👩🏽‍💻.

I like finding solutions to problems; I am always curious about new and existing technologies.

Apart from coding, I also like gaming 🎮, watching anime 🦊, ~~listening to audiobooks~~ reading books is better 📚, sketching 📝, journaling ✍🏽, sharing my opinions on social media which nobody really cares about ✌🏽.

Sometimes, I like shit-posting on Twitter: http://twitter.com/shreyashah115
