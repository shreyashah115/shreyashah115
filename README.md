I have 3 years of experience working at different startups as a software engineer.

I like finding solutions to problems; I am curious about new and existing technologies which help transform my ideas to something incredible on a screen.
I have mostly been a backend engineer. I believe I have meticulous attention to detail when it comes to building or designing something.

Apart from coding, I also like gaming, listening to audiobooks, and cooking (a newly discovered hobby).
